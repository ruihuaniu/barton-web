## Issues, Reasons & Solutions

1.  `require` doesn't work with images
    > egï¼š `<img src={require("../public/images/serene.png")} />` isn't working even the Webpack has been well configured (`esModule:false` with `file-loader` doesn't work), the images just don't show up on the page.  
    > The error message is 404 (Not Found), and the Elements is `<img src="[object Module]" >` on DevTools.

- My fix is to add `.default` at the end of `src` property , like '<img src={require("../public/images/serene.png").default} />`. It's a little weird, but it works.

2.  next-optimized-images plugin doesn't work

- This plugin must work with `require` or `import` when dealing with images
- `require` must be statically analyzable, which means it cannot handle with variables
- My workaround is to add `require` as a prefix in the database, so that the map loop can work well with variables.
